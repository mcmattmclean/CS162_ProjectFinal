# MiskatonicMadness

This is a basic little text game I created inspired by the Arkham Horror board game. The player moves
around the Miskatonic University, exploring the world around them and trying to gather the necessary
materials to close a gate opened by the old ones before their constantly draining sanity runs out.

BEATING THE GAME (Spoilers!):

You start in the courtyard. Move west to the Administration Building, then north to Professor Harvey's
office. Once in the office, explore. A monster will appear and you will have four options.

The first option will do no damage.
The second will do 50 damage.
The third option will allow to beat the monster, adding the Monstrous Corpse item to your inventory,
and acquiring the professor as an ally.
The fourth option will do 100 damage, killing you.

You can use option 2 or 4 to test dying logic.
Otherwise, choose option 3 to continue. Press enter at the prompts, then move south, back
to the Administration building. Move east to the Courtyard, then south to the Science Building.

Once at the Science Building, explore, and your Monstrous Corpse will be traded for the Research
Notes item. Press enter at the prompts.

Move north back to the Courtyard, then east to the Library.

Once at the Library, explore. Press enter at the prompts, and then select the solve option.
The combination is 12 30 18. Prompts are printed for each number, but you can enter them all at once
if you wish. Press enter at the prompts, then move east to the secret room.

Explore in the secret room to acquire the Ancient Tome item.

Next, move west to the Library, then west again to return to the Courtyard. From the Courtyard,
travel north to the Gate.

Explore the gate. With all the required items, you can now press enter at all the prompts to
finish the game.

Testing Help:

Going to the gate before having the professor, you can explore the gate to lose 6 sanity at a time.
This can help test the gameOver condition for sanity loss.
