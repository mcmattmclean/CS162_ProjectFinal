# MiskatonicMadness

This is a basic little text game I created inspired by the Arkham Horror board game. The player moves 
around the Miskatonic University, exploring the world around them and trying to gather the necessary
materials to close a gate opened by the old ones. 

There's a fair amount of refinement to be done in terms of game logic tracking, and I'm hoping to make
changes to the general engine of the game to make it easier to add new rooms and puzzles in the future.

Additional graphics will be coming shortly.
