# MiskatonicMadness

This is a basic little text game I created inspired by the Arkham Horror board game. The player moves
around the Miskatonic University, exploring the world around them and trying to gather the necessary
materials to close a gate opened by the old ones before their constantly draining sanity runs out.s
